# Arcomage HD Alt Art

This is fork of the "Arcomage HD" by Tom Chen with my alternative art.

I don't try to exactly redraw the original cards. The main thing is that they correspond to the meaning and look nice. But I try to be cannonical.

Although my fork does not fully correspond to the canon, I think the new version of the cards looks much more interesting.

The card images replacing is in progress, although not all the cards have been replaced yet.
